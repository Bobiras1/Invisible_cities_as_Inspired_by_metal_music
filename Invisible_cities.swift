print("Jamrosa is a rather unpredictable city..!! through windows corridors alleys streets art and it's infamous fog she makes her inhabitants feel, a wicked rather psychedelic feeling...Jamrosa is a rather difficult city to understand even to enter...so are her inhabitants. Their feelings are difficult to approach or perceive this is how Jamrosa works with them, an always live city that uses her inhabitants feelings to self-replicate co-create develop and at night deactivate...Sounds strange? it is and it is not....everything we compose only has meaning until it decomposes to be recomposed yet again to something new. Jamrosa is the city of kings- Paranoid and rational the same time even with this Paranormal feeling when you live in a Parasomniac situation...they feel something went wrong with their city, but their problems are the reason the city is being composed , de-composed and recomposed all happening the same era!!! The drums always thunderous in Jamrosa remind me to be humble the guitars destroy the quiet sky it's just this heavy metal music emotion that drives Jamrosas logic to the future!!!The future is not a calm sea of course but a Paranoid situation with contrasts over and over one upon the other and inside of it...!!! what is darkness without light???this is Jamrosas citizens question and finally commerce attitude...entering Jamrosas gates there is this sign!!! Never leave anything for next day you have to act right in the present right this moment!!!life wont wait for ever. This is their attitude.")
